Warning! There is no datasheet with informations about the configuration of LED and GPIO outputs of the 9512 chip.
I figured out how to drive the LEDs by trial and error and by reading the source code of the smsc9512 driver.
So there is a chance that there are side effects although I have not observed any until now.

Usage:
Call the program without parameters. A help message is shown.

Raw values:
The GPIO control register is 32 bits wide. It is easier to look at them as 8 nibbles with the most significat nibble on the left

N7 N6 N5 N4 N3 N2 N1 N0

from the source code we can see that N4, N5 and N6 are used to configure the LEDs
Writing a 1 into this nibble means that the LEDs are used as status display.

N4 controls the duplex LED
N5 controls the link LED
N6 controls the speed (100M) LED

Writing a 0 into this nibble means that the LED can be controlled independently and you can switch them on and off as you like.
In order to to this we have to watch at the bits of N1

B7 B6 B5 B4

B4 controls the duplex LED
B5 controls the link LED
B6 controls the speed (100M) LED
B7 does nothing

'1' switches the LED on, '0' means off

You will notice that the link LED is not flickering and even if you switch the interface to 10M or half duplex the LEDs do not reflect these changes. You can really use them for other purposes.

I hope this explanation is clear. Feel free to ask.
